            "paragraph": "It is commonly believed that the best way to improve the quality of a product is to focus on the process of its creation. However, recent research suggests that focusing on the outcome of a product can also improve its quality. In one study, researchers asked participants to create origami cranes and instructed half of the participants to focus on the process of folding the paper, while instructing the other half to focus on the outcome of creating a beautiful crane. The results showed that the participants who focused on the outcome were more likely to produce a high-quality crane. This finding suggests that focusing on the outcome of a product can lead to higher-quality results, even though the process of creation is often emphasized as being the most important factor in quality improvement.",

The author is acknowledging that the process of creation is often emphasized as being important, but then they argue that focusing on the outcome can also contribute to quality improvement. Therefore, the phrase \"even though\" indicates that the author believes the process of creation is not the only factor that contributes to quality improvement.",

Now, with the advent of social media, email, and instant messaging, we can connect with people all over the world in an instant. This shift in communication has led to a more interconnected world, but it has also brought with it some challenges.

It's important to be mindful of the way we communicate online and to be aware of the potential for misunderstandings.",

The narrator is being driven in a carriage through a remote region at night.\nThe baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.",
            "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201cdisturbed\u201d most nearly means alarmed. The text portrays the narrator traveling in a carriage as wolves howl in the surrounding darkness. The text contrasts the reaction of both the narrator and the horses pulling the carriage with that of the driver of the carriage: the narrator and horses are \u201cdreadfully afraid,\u201d but the driver is \u201cnot in the least disturbed.\u201d In other words, the driver is not alarmed by the wolves nearby.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \u201cdisturbed\u201d can mean disorganized, the text doesn\u2019t portray a character acting in a disorganized manner; instead, the driver continues to drive the carriage, even though the horses pulling it are alarmed. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \u201cdisturbed\u201d can mean offended, the text doesn\u2019t portray one character feeling offended, or upset, by another\u2019s actions; instead, it contrasts the fear felt by the narrator with another character\u2019s lack of fear. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \u201cdisturbed\u201d can mean interrupted, the text doesn\u2019t portray an action being interrupted; indeed, the travel depicted in the scene continues despite the threat of the wolves outside the carriage.",
