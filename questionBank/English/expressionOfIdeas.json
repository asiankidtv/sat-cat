But, as I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve become much more cautious. I tend to stick to what I know, and I avoid taking risks. I\u2019m not sure when this change happened, but I feel like it\u2019s been a gradual process. Now, when faced with a new opportunity, I\u2019m more likely to think of all the reasons why I shouldn\u2019t do it, rather than all the reasons why I should. Sometimes, I wish I could go back to that younger, more adventurous version of myself.
