Some critics even went so far as to say that the novel was nothing more than a form of escapism.  But despite the criticisms, the novel continued to thrive, and it has remained one of the most popular literary genres to this day.  Even today, writers are still using the novel to explore new ideas and to tell compelling stories.

However, if we rewrite the sentences so that the subject of the second sentence is a pronoun, then the rules for punctuation are slightly different.  For example, consider the following two sentences: \"She went to the store.

It was not until recent years that they noticed a change in the population of the algae. The decline in algae populations is not necessarily the result of human activity. The researchers are looking at other possible explanations for this decline.  The researchers hope to identify the root cause of the decline by studying the algae over time.  What is the main idea of the passage?",
            "explanation": "The passage states that the decline in *C. crispus* populations is not necessarily the result of human activity, but that the researchers are looking at other possible explanations for the decline.  This suggests that human activity may be a factor, but the researchers are unsure about the root cause of the decline.",

            "paragraph": "A team of researchers has been studying the habits of a small species of bird, the blue-footed booby, in order to determine how the birds choose their mates. The researchers found that, in general, blue-footed boobies prefer to mate with individuals that have the largest feet.  The researchers theorize that larger feet may be an indicator of health and fitness.  In order to further their research, the team wanted to determine whether the birds\u2019 preference for large feet is a learned behavior or an instinctive one.  To this end, the researchers conducted an experiment in which some blue-footed boobies were raised in captivity and then released into the wild.   To measure the birds\u2019 preference for large feet, the researchers observed whether the birds, when given a choice between two potential mates, would choose the mate with the larger feet.  Of the twenty birds that were raised in captivity, fourteen chose the mate with the larger feet.  This finding suggests that the blue-footed booby\u2019s preference for large feet may be an instinctive behavior, rather than a learned one.  Although the researchers\u2019 findings do not prove their hypothesis, the results are suggestive.  However, the researchers acknowledged that their experiment had a significant limitation.  The birds were only allowed to choose between two potential mates, so it is not possible to know for certain that the birds would choose the mate with the larger feet if given more options.  Furthermore, the researchers did not consider other factors that may have influenced the birds\u2019 mate selection, such as the birds\u2019 age or the availability of food.  Despite these limitations, the researchers\u2019 findings suggest that there is a genetic component to blue-footed boobies\u2019 preference for large feet.",

            "paragraph": "The 1960s saw a flowering of experimental poetry. Poets in this period were not content to simply record their observations; they wanted to challenge readers\u2019 expectations of what poetry could be. As a result, poets began to experiment with form and style, often using unconventional techniques and language.  One such poet was E. E. Cummings, whose poems are known for their unconventional use of punctuation and capitalization. For example, the poem \"i sing of Olaf glad and big\" features lines that are not only broken up in unexpected ways but also contain words that are run together without spaces. \"i carry your heart with me(i carry it in\nmy heart)\" is another example of Cummings\u2019s unconventional punctuation, a poem that is broken up into lines of varying lengths and that uses parentheses to set off an extended metaphor.

The aurora borealis, a natural phenomenon that occurs when charged particles from the sun interact with the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, is a breathtaking spectacle that is sure to inspire wonder in anyone lucky enough to witness it. The word \"symphony\" is used to emphasize the beauty and grandeur of the northern lights. \"Symphonic\" would be an incorrect choice because it doesn\u2019t accurately convey the sense of movement and change that is inherent in the northern lights.  The choice of \"symphony\" suggests that the northern lights are a grand and complex spectacle, similar to a piece of music. \"Symphonic\" would be an incorrect choice because it doesn\u2019t accurately convey the sense of movement and change that is inherent in the northern lights.

The semicolon is also used correctly to connect the third and fourth sentences because the fourth sentence continues the idea from the third.  A semicolon is used to connect closely related independent clauses.  A comma splice is when two independent clauses are connected with only a comma, which creates a grammatical error. A comma splice is also created when a comma is used incorrectly before a coordinating conjunction.  A comma followed by a coordinating conjunction can be used correctly to connect two independent clauses but not when the two clauses are not closely related.  A colon can be used to introduce a list but is not the correct choice here because the second sentence is not a list.

While her books, in general, were well received by critics, the public\u2019s response was mixed. Some novels, like *Pride and Prejudice*, are considered masterpieces of English literature, while others, such as *Mansfield Park*, were not as well regarded.  \nOne is tempted to wonder what Austen, a woman of great sensibility and talent, thought of the public\u2019s indifference to some of her works. \nEven if she couldn\u2019t have predicted the popularity of her novels, the fact that *Pride and Prejudice* is still a bestseller today is testament to Austen\u2019s ability to write enduring stories. \nHowever, because of the public\u2019s indifferent response to some of her works, it\u2019s also reasonable to assume that Austen may have been disappointed by the lack of recognition for her novels. \nPerhaps Austen, having learned to accept that readers often did not value her work, eventually grew indifferent to such critical reception. \nWhat would Austen, with her sharp intellect, think of the modern celebrity culture obsessed with recognition, awards, and prizes?",

This trend can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the rise of privacy concerns, the spread of misinformation, and the increasing pressure to maintain a perfect online image. But even those who do not use social media still benefit from the technologies that power it. For example, many people rely on GPS for navigation, which is a technology that was developed for the military. And the same technology that makes it possible to stream videos online also makes it possible to track the movement of goods across the globe.

While some scholars believe that the most important aspect of the study of history is the exploration of the past through the examination of primary sources, others argue that a more holistic approach is needed, one that considers the broader historical context and the impact of historical events on the present.  The following passage from a scholarly essay discusses this debate.  \n\n      \"Historians have long debated the best way to approach the study of history.  Some historians argue that the best way to understand the past is to focus on primary sources.  They argue that these sources provide an unfiltered look into the past, allowing historians to see the world through the eyes of those who lived it.  However, other historians contend that a more holistic approach is needed, one that considers the broader historical context in which events occurred, as well as the impact of those events on the present.  To understand the past, they argue, it is necessary to see the world as a complex web of interconnected events that have shaped the present.   In other words, they suggest, it is important to avoid viewing history as a series of isolated facts.   \n\n        In this way, the two approaches can be seen as two sides of the same coin.  Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses.  Historians who focus on primary sources are more likely to produce accounts that are grounded in the evidence.  However, their accounts may also be more limited in scope, failing to address the complexities of the historical context.   \n\n        Historians who take a more holistic approach are more likely to produce accounts that are broader in scope and more nuanced in their understanding of the past.    However, their accounts may also be more prone to bias and interpretation.   \n\n        Ultimately, the best way to approach the study of history is to find a balance between these two approaches.\"  \n\n       What is the most likely reason that the author of this passage refers to the two approaches as \u201ctwo sides of the same coin\u201d?

Which of the following sentences is written most clearly and concisely?",

For example, Choice A is incorrect because the modifying phrase \"which explained the methods they used, the data they gathered, and the conclusions they reached\" is unnecessarily wordy. Choice B is incorrect because the use of a comma after \"detailed\" creates a comma splice. Choice C is incorrect because it\u2019s grammatically incorrect.

The first independent clause is \"The scientist explained that the sense of smell is more powerful than the sense of sight.\" The second independent clause is \"this theory was supported by a recent study that found that people were more likely to remember a happy memory when they smelled a familiar scent than when they saw a familiar picture.\" The two clauses are related because the second clause provides evidence for the first clause. Semicolons are often used to separate two related independent clauses when a conjunction is not used.",

            "paragraph": "The first recorded use of the word \u201cjazz\u201d to describe music was in the early 1900s, but the music that the word referred to had already been around for a while. The earliest form of jazz came out of African American culture, which was, in turn, influenced by both European musical traditions and West African musical traditions, giving it a distinctly American sound. But, some historians argue that the earliest forms of jazz were not recognized as \u201cjazz\u201d until after the invention of jazz music\u2019s most important instrument: the saxophone. Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?",
            "explanation": "The text tests the punctuation of a nonessential element. Choice A is the best answer because it correctly sets off the nonessential element \"the invention of jazz music\u2019s most important instrument: the saxophone.\" with a pair of commas.  The other choices are incorrect because they either incorrectly use a comma or incorrectly use a semicolon or a dash to set off the nonessential element.  A semicolon is used to separate two main clauses or to separate items in a complex series, and a dash is used to separate a nonessential element from the rest of a sentence or to indicate an abrupt shift in thought. The use of a dash in the other choices is incorrect because there is no abrupt shift in thought or break in the sentence.",

The two stars that appear closest to each other are so close together that they appear to be a single star. ",
            "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it accurately combines the two sentences using a transition word that signals a contrast. The transition word \"though\" creates a logical connection between the two ideas, showing that despite the fact that astronomers know there are only six stars, the stars that appear closest to each other appear to be one star. Choice A uses the transition word \"and\" to connect the two sentences, which is not the best choice because it does not create a sense of contrast. Choice C uses the transition word \"and\" to connect the two sentences, which is not the best choice because it does not create a sense of contrast. Choice D uses a semicolon to connect the two sentences, which is not the best choice because a semicolon is generally used to connect related independent clauses, but the two sentences in this case are not independent clauses.
