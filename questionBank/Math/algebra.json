            "paragraph": "null",
            "explanation": "Because the change in the number of students decreases by the same percentage each year, the relationship between the number of students and the number of years can be modeled with a decreasing exponential function in the form \\(f(x) = a(1 - r)^x\\) where \\(f(x)\\) is the number of students, a is the number of students in 2015, r is the rate of decrease each year, and x is the number of years since 2015. It's given that 3,000 students were enrolled in 2015 and that the rate of decrease is predicted to be 2%, or 0.02. Substituting these values into the decreasing exponential function yields \\(f(x) = 3,000(1 - 0.02)^x\\), which is equivalent to \\(f(x) = 3,000(0.98)^x\\).",

Substituting this into the equation \\(4x + y = 11\\) gives \\(4(\\frac{10 - 2y}{3}) + y = 11\\).
