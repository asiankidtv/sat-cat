Dividing both sides by 3, we get v = 33.33. Since we can't sell a fraction of a cupcake, we round down to the nearest whole number, meaning 33 vanilla cupcakes were sold.

Since 20 people liked both, we can fill in the overlap with 20. Since 60 people liked apples total, and 20 liked both, then 60-20 = 40 people liked only apples. Similarly, 40-20 = 20 people liked only oranges. This gives us a total of 40 + 20 + 20 = 80 people who liked at least one of the fruits.
