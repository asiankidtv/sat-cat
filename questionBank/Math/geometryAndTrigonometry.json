            "paragraph": "null",
            "explanation": "If the circle intersects the line at exactly one point, the line is tangent to the circle. This means the radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the line. The slope of the line y = 4x + b is 4, so the slope of the radius is \u20131/4.  The radius passes through (0, 0), so the equation of the radius is y = \u20131/4x. To find the point of tangency, we substitute y = \u20131/4x into the equation of the line, which gives us \u20131/4x = 4x + b. Solving for x yields x = \u2013b/17. Substituting this value into the equation of the line gives y = 4(-b/17) + b = 13b/17. The point of tangency has coordinates (-b/17, 13b/17). The distance from this point to the center of the circle, (0, 0), is 5, so we can set up the distance formula: \\begin{align*}\\sqrt{(-b/17 - 0)^2 + (13b/17 - 0)^2} &= 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\sqrt{(b^2/289) + (169b^2/289)} &= 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\sqrt{(170b^2/289)} &= 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 170b^2/289 &= 25\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 170b^2 &= 7,225\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad b^2 &= 42.5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad b &= \\pm 6.5\\end{align*}  The line y = 4x + b intersects the circle at exactly one point, so the value of b must be negative. Therefore, b = -6.5, which is equivalent to -20/3, or -20/3.  Note that -20/3, -6.5, and -6.50 are all acceptable ways to enter a correct answer.",

            "paragraph": "null",
            "explanation": "Let's break down the solution:\n\n1. **Equilateral Triangle Properties:** An equilateral triangle has three equal sides and three equal angles of 60 degrees.  The height of an equilateral triangle divides it into two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n\n2. **30-60-90 Triangle Properties:** The sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are in the ratio of 1:\u221a3:2. Since the side length of the equilateral triangle is 6, the height of the triangle is 3\u221a3. The radius of the inscribed circle is equal to 1/3 of the height, so the radius of the inscribed circle is \u221a3.\n\n3. **Area of a Circle:** The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where r is the radius.  Substituting \u221a3 for r, we get $A = \\pi (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 3\\pi$.\n\n4. **Final Answer:** Since the circle is inscribed in the equilateral triangle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the height of the triangle, which is 3\u221a3.  Therefore, the radius of the circle is (3\u221a3)/2, and the area of the circle is $\\pi (\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \\frac{27\\pi}{4}$, which is equivalent to .",

            "explanation": "The equation of the circle with center at the origin and radius 5 is $x^2 + y^2 = 25$.  We can solve the system of equations $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ and $x + y = 7$ to find the points of intersection. Solving for $x$ in the second equation, we get $x = 7 - y$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $(7-y)^2 + y^2 = 25$. Expanding the equation, we get $49 - 14y + y^2 + y^2 = 25$. Combining like terms, we get $2y^2 - 14y + 24 = 0$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $y^2 - 7y + 12 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(y-3)(y-4) = 0$. Therefore, $y = 3$ or $y = 4$. Substituting these values back into the equation $x = 7 - y$, we get the points of intersection as $(4,3)$ and $(3,4)$. The distance between these two points can be found using the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(4-3)^2 + (3-4)^2} = \\sqrt{1+1} = \\sqrt{2}$.  Thus, the distance between the two points is $5\\sqrt{2}$.",

We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the other leg (the distance from the center to the chord):  $6^2 = 4^2 + d^2$, where $d$ is the distance from the center of the circle to the chord.  Solving for $d$, we find $d = \\sqrt{6^2 - 4^2} = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}$.

Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\sqrt{64} = 8$. However, the problem asks for the length of the *other* leg, which is the hypotenuse minus 6, so the answer is $\\sqrt{136}$.",
